TITAN
=====

The TITAN is a tiny RepRap based 3D printer. With a 190x190x190 footprint it can print objects up to 80x80x70mm. It is designed for easy transport so sturdy, light and small.

Status
======

The TITAN is under heavy development. The first prototype is still being assembled, and it has not printed yet.

The design files are uploaded, but unfinished at the moment. The following parts are missing:
* Motor brackets
* Extruder
* Bowden tube clamps
* Z lifting system

Parts
=====

I did not make a full Bill Of Materials yet. But my currently used parts are:

* 2x LM8UU bearings
* 1x Ultimaker hotend
* 1x Ultimaker bowden tube
